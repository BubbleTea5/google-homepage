Recreating Google's Homepage

Took ~10 hours total, biggest difficulties were figuring out were sizing and deciding which units/positions to use and when. 

Problems:

- Google logo doesnt retain size and shift up as page is zoomed in.
- Similar issue for search bar
- Links on the footer don't wrap when zooming in.
- Minor position problems.
